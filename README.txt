Hi,
This game was developed in Unity 2020.3.20f1 but was upgrated to 2020.3.34f1 the last day for publishing in the Google Play Store, if you have problems for building in ABB
just upgrade the project version to the last Unity version, beleive me it will save you time.

Also, in the Microphone Script if you plan to use this script, just delete everything that reference to UI and then in the script you want use MicrophoneScript.IsBlowing
it's an static variable so you will not have problems to reference to it.
Godd luck.
